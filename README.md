# Pokedex-simple-js

A simple Pokedex that displays some basic information on various Pokemon. I used some basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Javascript is used to asyncronously via fetch and promises to receive data from an external API. The app is dependant on https://pokeapi.co and loads up to 150 pokemon. Bootstrap framework is used for formatting the UI.
